Angular Js is a Java Script framework.
  It is used for developing Client side Rich Internet Applications (RIA).
  It uses HTML as templating language to build amazing dynamic web applications.
  It is based on the MVC pattern.
  It Separates your RIA applicaition in to Model + View + Controller.
              Views are defined as HTML Content
              Model + Controller is defined as javascript
              
Conceptual Overview:
  1.  Template --> HTML and additional Markup.
  2.  Directives  --> Extend HTML with custom attributes and elements.
  3.  Model --> The data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts.
  4.  Scope --> Context where model is stored so that controllers,directives and expressions can use it.
  5.  Expressions --> Access variables and functions them from scope.
  6.  Compiler  --> Parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions.
  7.  Filter  --> Formats the value of the expression for display of the user.
  8.  View -->  What the user sees (HTML Content)
  9.  Data Binding -->  Sync data between the model and view
  10. Controller  --> It holds the bussiness login.
  11. Dependency Injection  --> Creates and wires object and functions
  12. Injector  --> Dependency Injection container
  13. Module  --> A container for the different parts of an app including controllers, filters , services, directives which configures the injector.
  14. Service --> reusable business logic independent of view
